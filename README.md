## Dependancies

### Python Packages 
- _Will Update_
### External Requirements
- XeTeX - For rendering _devan&#x101;gari_ words 
- [Shobhika](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/shobhika?lang=en) - A well typeset font which includes many special characters  

_Edit the LaTeX preamble as you wish to change the typesetting (you might need to change the files that have the names of naks&#803;atras etc.)_

## To do :
- Comment code for better reading and usability
